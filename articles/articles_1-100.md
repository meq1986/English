### 40. [Love Song to Costco](https://longreads.com/2022/06/16/love-song-to-costco-3/)

文章很长，读了好几天。  
一个华人作家写的，有关Costco，一个大型的平价超市。  
通过描写跟Costco有关的家庭故事，展现出移民的心态。  

虽然都是小事，但能从中看到大时代的历史，文化冲突。  
作者是一个诗人，很厉害，母语中文，但用英文写诗。  

阅读此类文学性质的文章，的确跟新闻稿不同。  
文学性质的文字，生词多，笔触细腻，用词不同，表达的思想感情都不同。  
这个需要字斟句酌，好好体会。 跟中文的道理是一样的。  

而读新闻稿，博客，也有生词，但都是流行用法，比较简单。
